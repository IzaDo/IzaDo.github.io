        <a name="Introduction"><b>Introduction</b></a>
        <p>Think about the last board game you have played. Chances are, you probably can't even remember exactly what the game was about. So, let's back up for a second and travel back in time a bit.
        Before the advent of computer games, great fantasy stories could only be captured by books, screenplay and movies. Those left wanting for more came up with
        <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">Dungeons&Dragons</a> in 1972.</p>
        <p>In it's simplest form, D&D isn't a game that kind of plays itself, like other popular board games. Rather it provides an extensive library of Races and Classes, to make
        yourself an Adventurer and then supplies you with a basic ruleset for attacks, spells and what not. The content of the game though, is up to you. Imagine talking and acting
        like a swashbuckling pirate or a nature-upholding druid, while fighting against literally anything you can think of. All action takes place in the players head and is guided by a so called
        Dungeon Master. He's the one essentially telling a - mostly improvised - tale, taking the players along for the ride. "You see a broken carriage on the side of the street? Would you want to investigate?"</p>
        <p>And this is where the true art of being a good Dungeon Master comes into play. Each player has different physical and mental capabilities, depending on what kind of character you decide
        to play as. So let's say, after seeing this imaginary carriage on the side of the road, you decide to investigate what has happened. You might turn to your DM and say:
        "I want to check the carriage for supplies to plunder" or maybe "I rush to the scene and look for clues of any fighting that has happened, maybe there are wounded people around." Now,
        you being the smart player that you are have decided to create a truly brainsy little orc, who has advantage in Investigation. The way that D&D handles any kind of situation that a player
        might find themselves in when running around in their fictional world is by rolling dice. Typically, this is done with a 20-sided dice - such dice have now become iconic
        for exactly this reason.</p>
        <p>Let's say you roll a 10. Not great, but average at least. Your character though, as we've said before, has advantage on Investigation checks. This typically means you can add a fixed
        number to any Investigation roll you do. Looking at your stat sheet, you add +2 to you roll, so now your Investigation ended up having a value of 12. Not half bad. This is where the
        Dungeon Master comes in. He might know, since he is the one creating all the situations the players find themselves in, that for discovering a muddy footprint on the back of the carriage
        you had to have rolled a 14 or higher. So the DM turns to you and says: "As you look around the carriage, you notice the broken wheels and find that they actually have been
        cut by what looks to you like an axe or something similar. You can see before your imaginary eye the passengers running away in a hurry, but you can't make out where they might have run to."</p>
        <p>This is the basic gameplay for D&D. An really, the sky is the limit here. You may find yourself, as I have in a session once, rolling an Agility check on your
        400 year old druid elf for jumping infront of a firebolt casted by your companion Half-Demon that turns into a rage everytime she fights - just to protect a villager helping you out in a fight
        against an Owl-Bear. If that's the kind of crazy characters and situations you may find yourself enjoying, Dungeons and Dragons might be worth a shot. There are groups of players out there that
        have been playing with the same characters, in the same world, for over 20 years. The amount of world-building and character developement really is unlimited. Unless your character dies
        of course - there is no way of coming back from the dead. The game as a whole can provide as much realism as you want it to, rolling dice for the weather, buying food and cooking, etc.
        But let's be honest, most players don't play D&D for the realism, so you can add as much or as little as you like to your own campaign.</p>

        <p>Sparked your interest? Here's a table of character attributes available in the latest installment of the game, Dungeons and Dragons Version 5e. Glancing over this should give you a general
        idea of what you can do in this game, although the possbibilities are limitless. The books that D&D provides are meant to give a basic structure to the game.</p>

            <tr>
              <td>Strength</td>
              <td>Look at those abs! High strength makes you a force to be reckoned with, destroying everything in your path. Blunt weapons might be enhanced by this stat, as well as any action that relies on pure, brute force.</td>

            <tr>
              <td>Dexterity</td>
              <td>You're a nimble fighter, twisting and turning yourself out of harm's way. This stat improves your acrobatic skills, but also stealth and sleight of hand. No shame in making a quick buck, nobody is going to miss that ancient relic anyway.</td>

            <tr>
              <td>Constitution</td>
              <td>You're a meat shield, keeping foes at a distance while your allies take care of the rest. You can ignore hunger, thrist, cold and heat and can endure anything blocking your parties path forward.</td>

              <td>Intelligence</td>
              <td>You're a smartass. You always did well in mage school, and hate getting your hands dirty. Or you might be a druid, with knowledge about the true self of nature, intelligently guiding your party through the deep forests.</td>

            <tr>
              <td>Wisdom</td>
